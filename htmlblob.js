                  <p class="main-content-p">Total Cinema 360 is a full service production company specializing in 360 degree video and virtual reality technology. We create unprecedented, interactive experiences that allow you to look beyond the edges of the frame and relieve the action as if you were there.</p>

                 <h2 class="content-h">What is 360 Video?</h2>

                  <p class="content-p">360 Video is a new media technology that uses multiple camera lenses to capture different sides of a space simultaneously and stitch the images together to form a seamless environment. At playback, users control where they are looking from a fixed point in a visual sphere, resulting in an unparalleled level of immersion.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">How can I watch 360 Videos? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">Our content is available on computers, mobile devices, tablets, and the OCULUS RIFT, a next-generation virtual reality headset. The interface is different depending on the device. To adjust your view on the computer, click and drag with the mouse or use the keypad. For mobile phones and tablets, use the touchscreen or physically move the device in the direction you wish to look. The Oculus Rift responds to the movements of your head.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">What is the Oculus Rift? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">The Oculus Rift is a Head Mounted Display (virtual reailty goggles) developed by Oculus VR for high quality gaming and virtual reality experiences.  We create all our 360 videos specifically with the Oculus Rift in mind as the optimal viewing medium. Oculus Rift Development Kits are currently available to order directly from Oculus VR. A release date for the commercial version of the Rift has not been announced.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">Is there 360 Sound? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">Yes! We can design audio environments that are responsive to your perspective in the video. So, if two conversations are happening simultaneously, we can make it so you only hear the people you're paying attention to. Look this way, hear one thing. Look that way, hear another. Applying this technique is optional. The further development of 360 audio recording and design technologies is one of our top priorities. You can download our 360 Sound Demo along with the Total Cinema 360 Oculus Player to hear it for it yourself.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">Can you watch 360 Videos without the 360 element? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">Yes. Any 360 Video can be turned into traditional video formats. You can even choose the path the camera follows and make different versions of the same video.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">What type of content do you create with 360 video? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">We are currently in development on several fiction and non-fiction video projects across all platforms. 360 Video is perfect for storytelling, live events, advertising, guided tours, training services, mapping services, conferencing, and even video games. We believe that anything you can capture with traditional video can benefit from 360 technology. </p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">What are you doing next? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">Our main goal right now is to come up with as many applications for 360 video as possible. We will soon be launching a remodeled version of our player with additional features and interface options, as well as several new videos to go along with it. We want our content to be available on a wide range of devices and in a wide variety of ways. Innovative technologies like the Rift are definitely a priority. We also believe 360 cameras can get much, much better. </p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">Can you live stream 360 videos? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">Yes.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">Where are you located? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">Total Cinema 360 is based in New York City. 

                  <h2 class="content-h">Do you sell cameras? </h2>

                  <p class="content-p">No, we do not sell hardware at this time. New 360 cameras are constantly in development and we will make them available as soon as we have settled on a long term model.</p>

                  <h2 class="content-h">How do I make my own 360 videos? </h2>
